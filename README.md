## December 21st, 2018

* Worked on EZcrypt (encryption/decryption tool written in Java)
* Registered domain name: alans100daysofcode.com (I will set it up later)
* Looked up basic info about Github Pages and Jekyll, which I will use for my new site -- at least for now. Later, I plan on finishing my static site generator project, either in Python or Java.
* Got back into doing this daily progress log
* Decided that I should learn CI at some point, maybe Travis CI?

* Set up desk, desktop, and chair -- moving in more to new place
* Made alans100daysofcode github repo

## December 23rd, 2018

* Learned more about Github Pages and Jekyll
* Encountered tons of errors with Jekyll and my repo and site
* Planning on reinstalling macOS to sort out Ruby issues (and upgrade to Mojave)
* When I looked at guides that helped other people, none of it worked for me. It was a bunch of "works on my machine" type messages. This is why I should learn about containers. Docker and Kubernetes can help eliminate these kinds of problems. Very frustrating issues. 
* Wasted time with rbenv and rvm, didn't work for jekyll
* Reinstalled Windows on desktop, started to set up programs and settings
* Factory reset Kindle (for reading programming-related books)
* Backed up all data on MacBook to external hard drive (in preparation for doing a clean installation of macOS Mojave later)

* Merry Christmas!
* Reinstalled macOS Mojave on MacBook
* Fixed Jekyll issue on MacBook
* Installed lots of programs on Windows 10 desktop
* Finished new hardware changes to desktop
* Set up git again on laptop and desktop
* Set up MinGW, gcc, g++, msys, make, etc. on Windows and changed the path variable -- not as simple as macOS, but I did it
* Restored data from backup (macOS Time Machine)
* Installed Jekyll on Windows (among other programming stuff)
* Learning more about merge conflict because I'm using a desktop and laptop, so I have to git pull before doing git commit or git push

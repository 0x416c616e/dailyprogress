## December 21st, 2018

* Worked on EZcrypt (encryption/decryption tool written in Java)
* Registered domain name: alans100daysofcode.com (I will set it up later)
* Looked up basic info about Github Pages and Jekyll, which I will use for my new site -- at least for now. Later, I plan on finishing my static site generator project, either in Python or Java.

## December 23rd, 2018

* Learned more about Github Pages and Jekyll
* Encountered tons of errors with Jekyll and my repo and site
* Planning on reinstalling macOS to sort out Ruby issues (and upgrade to Mojave)
* When I looked at guides that helped other people, none of it worked for me. It was a bunch of "works on my machine" type messages. This is why I should learn about containers. Docker and Kubernetes can help eliminate these kinds of problems. Very frustrating issues. 
* Wasted time with rbenv and rvm, didn't work for jekyll
* Reinstalled Windows on desktop, started to set up programs and settings
* Factory reset Kindle (for reading programming-related books)

* Learning more about merge conflict because I'm using a desktop and laptop, so I have to git pull before doing git commit or git push

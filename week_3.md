# Daily Programming Log: Week 3

---

## January 14th, 2019

* Resuming learning where I left off last time
* More Python and GitHub learning
* Updated log and website
* More plans about current and future projects (static site generator and ticketing system)
* Temporarily shut down and moved file server because of room being painted soon

---

## January 15th, 2019

* Updated website and log
* Learned more about Python
* Decided to go with Tkinter instead of Qt for SSG GUI
* Made progress on static site generator
* Fixed time stamps for some things (I was still writing 2018 instead of 2019)
* Read some chapters in some programming books
* Set up WAMP server and MySQL Workbench
* Started with SQL in 10 minutes exercises and database setup
* Learned about reading/writing JSON in Python
* Reviewed a lot of computer science topics
* Wrote a looooooooong blog post today
* Did so much! Very productive day!

## January 16th, 2019

* Worked on Static Site Generator -- added documentation, project structure, etc.
* Got car fixed
* Updated log and website
* Learned more about Python file IO

---

## January 17th, 2019

* Added lots of documentation and planning/software engineering/braintstorming for Static Site Generator
* Created site project skeleton layout to show what it will be like when the generator is more complete (far from finished right now but I have some dummy/mockup stuff to demonstrate the eventual implementations that aren't quite there yet)
* Had vim glitches in cmder, so I switched to ConEmu intead -- better than git bash, powershell, or the command prompt.
* Learned about JSON schema enforcement, pip package manager, JSON schemas in general, and the pip python jsonschema package


---

## January 18th, 2019

* Watched a lot of videos about Python and programming concepts
* Intsalled Docker in a VM
* Inquired about a Java 8 vs. Java 11 issue, learned about Maven and OpenJFX
* Did another chapter in SQL in 10 Minutes
* Did some Python programming for SSG
* Learned more about git features like branching, merging, forking, and pull requests
* Learned more about APIs
* Came up with an idea for a WebExtension project: typo domain blocker, uses pattern matching to block typos that are one character off from an alexa top 500 domain (protect against typosquatting and phishing/malware)
* Did python algorithm practice interview question: pair sum problem (list of numbers, see if pairs of numbers in list add up to certain number, we'll call k)

## January 19th, 2018
* Learned more about Python, such as global keyword, logging, reviewed classes, argparse, etc.
* SQL chapter about WHERE clause
* Worked more on SSG project
	* Did JSON parsing and find-and-replace test as a mockup for my later plans for adding the content to the page templates (my own pseudo-MVC type thing, but not 100% the same)
* Updated alans100daysofcode.com and log
* Looked up random non-Python programming concepts

## January 20th, 2018

* Last day of this week's file
* Didn't end up finishing the JSON thing yesterday so I am doing more of it today
* Successfully did the first mini-test of getting input and replacing what the user enters, but now I need to change it and make it do JSON, then I also need to do the pagination algo stuff and also I have yet to do the article module which will get user input and then write json, need to modularize stuff etc. I have been doing a lot of Python learning, and thinking about how to break the SSG stuff into smaller problems, and how to algorithmically solve all of it, and also watched various tutorials online. But lately I haven't been doing a ton of coding on it. I needed to figure out this stuff first.
* Learned random stuff related to programming
* Learned singleton design pattern
* Updated website and log, had to make new week markdown

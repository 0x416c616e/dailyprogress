# Daily Programming Log: Week 8

---

## November 10th, 2019

I haven't been great with updating this repo, but here's what I've been doing today and in the past few weeks:

- Finished all chapters in my book except for the C++, back-end web development, and summary chapters
- Learned more about C++
- Created the structure for the back-end web development chapter, which focuses on MySQL, Apache, and PHP
- Wrote most of the SQL section
- Made a SQL command repo that corresponds with a SQL demonstration in the book

## November 13th, 2019

- Continuing to re-read my book and edit it again

## November 23rd, 2019

- Separated the back-end web development chapter into one for MySQL and one for Apache and PHP
- Made the structure/outline for the Apache and PHP chapter, but didn't start it yet
- Edited the SQL chapter and added OS-specific instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Completely finished the SQL chapter
- Finished the C++ section about pointers and memory
- Made a new C++ section, which is basically a capstone project for the chapter, similar to the Python weather bot or Java API data downloading project, or the front-end website stuff
- Basically, each programming language has a "real" project in it to demonstrate the concepts in a real way rather than only demonstrating basic functionality of a feature in a language
- New C++ will be about finding prime numbers and writing them to a csv file
- Remaining C++ sections: file IO and prime number project
- Remaining chapters: a couple sections in the C++ chapter, the entire Apache/PHP chapter, and the summary chapter

## November 25th, 2019

- Finished (this time for real) the pointers and memory section in the C++ chapter
- Finished the input/output section for C++
- Started the prime number section
- Made git repo for prime gap finder
- Learned a lot about prime numbers, prime gaps, prime gap distribution, gnuplot, etc.
- Taught myself how to use gnuplot
- Started using Eclipse instead of CLion for IntelliJ
- Using vim a lot too for quick stuff
- New C++ chapter capstone project involves C++, Bash, gnuplot script, etc.
- PrimeFinder project uses .dat files to store data because gnuplot dislikes .csv for some reason
- PrimeFinder can find primes, log primes and prime gaps, make checkpoints to restore from if it gets quit unexpectedly, graph as many numbers as you want, partitions data into multiple files of a manageable size, logs distribution of primes, and automatically generates graph images
- Haven't finished the writing portion of the C++ prime number project section, but the coding is mostly done
- Only remaining parts of book are the entire Apache/PHP chapter and some rewriting/adding on to the wrap-up chapter
- Came up with a list of stuff to add to the advanced stuff or possibly the appendix for a list of topics to look up after you've finished reading the book

## November 27th, 2019

- Finished prime finder program -- very complicated and many lines of code
- Finished simplified prime finder program (for book)
- Finished C++ chapter in book

# Daily Programming Log: Week 8

## November 10th, 2019

I haven't been great with updating this repo, but here's what I've been doing today and in the past few weeks:

- Finished all chapters in my book except for the C++, back-end web development, and summary chapters
- Learned more about C++
- Created the structure for the back-end web development chapter, which focuses on MySQL, Apache, and PHP
- Wrote most of the SQL section
- Made a SQL command repo that corresponds with a SQL demonstration in the book

- Continuing to re-read my book and edit it again

# Daily Programming Log: Week 8

---

## November 10th, 2019

I haven't been great with updating this repo, but here's what I've been doing today and in the past few weeks:

- Finished all chapters in my book except for the C++, back-end web development, and summary chapters
- Learned more about C++
- Created the structure for the back-end web development chapter, which focuses on MySQL, Apache, and PHP
- Wrote most of the SQL section
- Made a SQL command repo that corresponds with a SQL demonstration in the book

## November 13th, 2019

- Continuing to re-read my book and edit it again

## November 23rd, 2019

- Separated the back-end web development chapter into one for MySQL and one for Apache and PHP
- Made the structure/outline for the Apache and PHP chapter, but didn't start it yet
- Edited the SQL chapter and added OS-specific instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Completely finished the SQL chapter
- Finished the C++ section about pointers and memory
- Made a new C++ section, which is basically a capstone project for the chapter, similar to the Python weather bot or Java API data downloading project, or the front-end website stuff
- Basically, each programming language has a "real" project in it to demonstrate the concepts in a real way rather than only demonstrating basic functionality of a feature in a language
- New C++ will be about finding prime numbers and writing them to a csv file
- Remaining C++ sections: file IO and prime number project
- Remaining chapters: a couple sections in the C++ chapter, the entire Apache/PHP chapter, and the summary chapter

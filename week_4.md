## Rest of the week

I unfortunately didn't program for a couple days. Or, well, I did a little bit of progress on my SSG program's article module, but because it was on the article-menu branch, it didn't show up on my GitHub contributions section, making it look like I really didn't do anythnig at all. I was doing some coding, but not a whole lot. Also didn't update my website or log during that time. But now I'm getting back into the swing of things.
